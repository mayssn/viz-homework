-	The most interesting graph for me was the B with MEDV because it claims that that proportion of B is positively related to MEDV which,
to be honest I have very hard trouble to believe given the realities of racist America. Perhaps I am interpreting the graph wrong. 
-	Another interesting one is DIS to B: Places with lower B also tend to be closer to employment places, meaning in more central places. 

Other obveresvations
-	Age to distance: Older Houses are closer to employment places
o	Employment places are likely located in central areas. 
o	This thus reflects the possibilities of the car where only recently did we start to be able to build further from the centre (especially 
recently compared to when the study was published). 
-	Age LSTAT the older the lower the status. 
-	AGE To MEDV: Okay we said the older, the higher the status. And now we see the older the lower the lower the medv
o	This graph is sketchy in the table. I think they grouped all 100+ houses into the value 100 thus grouping all the values making it seem 
like there is a higher concentration whereas in truth they are sparsed. 
-	Age to PLT: It feels like the older the houses the higher the teachers per student ratio 
o	This is probably because the older, the closer to central places the more resources 
	(but this should not necessarily reflect in the form of a ratio because these areas also have higher number of students).  
o	Another reason could be because the  older places are in areas of higher “status” – as we saw earlier.
-	Crim to age: There is more likely to be crime in neighborhoods of older homes. 
o	That is probabaly because they are located in more central places. 
-	CRIM to DIS: Higher crimed neighborhoods tend to be of closer distance to employment centres. 
o	Obvious
-	CRIM to INDUS: VERY WEIRD GRAPH! INDUS is the proportion of non retail business in town. Probably all of the downtown is considered one town
and has the same value of INDUS thus all neighborhoods with higher crime are located in that one particular town. Areas with higher crime usually
have a minimum of 15% lower status population. Surprisingly, neighborhoods with very high lower status population percentage also have relatively 
less crime.
-	CRIM to LSTAT: Neighborhoods with LSTAT below 10 have almost no crime. Meaning places with higher status have almost no crime.
-	 CRIM to MEDV: Neighborhoods with higher crime also have lower median value. 
-	CRIM to NOX: Places with NOX under 0.55 have no crime! Maybe NOX makes people crazy. Just kidding, probably because of the relationship between
the quantity of NOX  with DIS, and the relationship with CRIM to dis (crime happens in more central places). 
-	CRIM to PT RATIO : This is a weird graph, reflects that all homes that are in areas of higher crime have a 20% PT ratio. This is probably because 
the 20% PTratio simply reflects one town: Downtown. 
-	DIS TO LSTAT: homes in neighborhoods with higher percentage of lower status pop are also more likely to be closer to employment centre. They are
more likely closer to urban areas. Homes in areas that are further out frin from central places tend to have less percentage of lower status.  
-	 INDUS to NOX: Positive correlation, obviously
-	LSTAT to MEDV: Negative relationship obviously 
-	NOX to AGE: Newer homes tend to have less NOX. That is probably because older homes = more central areas.
-	LSTAT and NOX : positive relationship.
-	Very interesting that the average number of rooms is mostly around 6. Different era.
-	LSTAT to RM: Negative relationship obviously (bigger homes in neighborhoods with less lower status %)
-	MEDV and RM: Positive relationship (obviously the more # of rooms the higher the MEDV)
